--- Dual-Arm SCA Boundary Learning Tutorial ---

1. Generate a dataset using this package:

https://github.com/sinamr66/SCA_data_construction

Follow the instructions in the README file, you should modify the following input paramaters:
- Sampling resolution (joint angle increment, the 'resolution' variable is a multipler for 10 deg increments, i.e. resolution=2 gives a 20deg increment)
- Location of the robot bases wrt to each other
- DH parameters of the manipulators
- Joint workspace constraints, if any. 

This will generate a folder ./data which contains text files for the collided (y=-1) and non-collided (y=+1) joint configurations in form of the 3D positions of all joints wrt. one of the robot bases (the one defined as the origin x = [0 0 0]). This is the feature space that the SCA Boundary is learned in, if you have N joints (for all robots) your feature vector is \xi \in R^{N*3}.

Tips: If the analyze_dataset.cpp node seg-faults, this means that your swap partition is not big enough to load the entire dataset on the working memory. The fix is to increase your swap size.

To do this follow the instructions here:

2. Install dependencies for SCABoundary-Learning package
- ML_toolbox: We use the cross-validation/grid-search functions + standard SVM learning (from libSVM libary).

3. Search for optimal hyper-parameters doing cross-validation with standard soft-margin SVM
boundary_learning_robots.m

This will generate the optimal hyper-parameters that achieve the highest TPR and lowest FPR.

Note: The training stage in is not linearly increasing, i.e. a sample size of 12k point takes around 1 day, while a sample size of 24k take around 3 days.

3. Learn a sparse SVM via Cuttting-Plane Training 
Using the optimal hyper-parameters learned from the previous step, you will now train a sparse SVM with a support vector budget K, this is set to default = 3,000.

Once you've followed all the steps, 



4. To evaluate your learnt sparse SVM, we now generate a model for SVMGrad package and test it

Follow the instructions in the README file.

5. Test it on the real robots using the IJRR testing package, this can be done in simulation.
